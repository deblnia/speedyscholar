Tukey Against the Mechanization of Statistical Inference, Alexander Campolo. Password: Evidence2020 Post-WWII / late 1900s: sciences defined knowledge as “the inference from sample to population” Evidence evaluated by null hypothesis testing and significance at the 5% level Tangential: many criticisms of threshold (arbitrary, artificial “straw-person” in null hypothesis, based on incoherent synthesis of different methods, causes estrangement from effect size and statistical power) How did statistical tests become ossified into mechanical, context-independent procedures? Porter shows behavioral sciences need to initiate new members and defend against external critics Tukey did not have this problem – he was a singular elite Tukey evokes values underlying rationale behind use of tests Did not envy physics, did not want the reductionist “mathematization of nature”, did not want extension of Weberian rationality Wanted judgement, experience and even pluralism Tukey advocated for empiricism based in perception and sense Manifesto called Data Analysis and Behavioral Science or Learning to Bear the Quantitative Man’s Burden by Shunning Badmandments Three criticisms of significance tests: sanctify results, reduce to binary decision (signal vs. noise), crowd out other analytical tools “Probabilistic worlds require both techniques for producing knowledge under conditions of uncertainty and, as Theodore Porter has shown, institutions for producing trust, perhaps even faith, in such knowledge.” “…subjective judgement, driven by empirical perceptions, must shepherd quantification across threacherous spans” Tukey was friends with Claude Shannon Tukey gave data an agentive voice “After the single-minded pursuit of optimality, “the next fetish to be attacked,” he suggested with some relish, “is the fetish of objectivity,” understood as “the fallacy that to a single body of data there corresponds a unique appropriate analysis.” Not procedural, mechanical, optimal valuation of objectivity but a communicative raitonality Orit Halpern vs. Daston, Galison, and Porter Tukey had a historical understanding of science Urged behavioral sciences to look to early days of elder sciences - Still problems with Tukey: ideas provide little consensus, connected to him, reflect an elite sensibility (mechanical forms of inference do not have this problem) Produces a “scientific self” from Gallison and Daston "],

Describes a line of business in which changing the law is a significant part of the business plan. Cites (well-funded, scalable, highly connected startups with mass appeal) like AirBnB, Uber, Tesla, the UFC, marijuana dispensaries and DraftKings as agents of regulatory change. Legislative change is achieved with: an initial breaking/operating in a grey area of the law (asking forgiveness not permission) which continues while the company grows “too big to ban”, and leverages their stakeholders to make the issues in question as publically salient as possible. Contrast with regulatory arbitrageurs, who takes law as a given and make minor alterations to their behavior Regulatory entreprenuers prefer executive and legislative bodies to judicial ones, which are less likely to be swayed by public opinion / an army of users. Silicon Valley is “known to foster a certain libertarian-leaning, freemarket ideology that views technology that appeals to the masses as democratic. Given this confluence of factors, it is not surprising that startups might be inclined to start a line of business fraught with legal uncertainty” “Operational deference” also bestowed on tech companies (as a function of public perception) Businesses not constrained by geography, while politics is "]
