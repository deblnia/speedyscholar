# [_How Not to How Not to Analyze Data: John W. Tukey Against the Mechanization of Statistical Inference_](https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/2020-05/attachments/Campolo_APS_Evidence.pdf){target="_blank"}, Alexander Campolo. {-}

- Post-WWII / late 1900s: sciences defined knowledge as "the inference from sample to population"
  - Evidence evaluated by null hypothesis testing and significance at the 5% level  
  - Tangential: many criticisms of threshold (arbitrary, artificial "straw-person" in null hypothesis, based on incoherent synthesis of different methods, causes estrangement from effect size and statistical power)
- How did statistical tests become ossified into mechanical, context-independent procedures?
  - Porter shows behavioral sciences need to initiate new members and defend against external critics 
  - Tukey did not have this problem -- he was a singular elite 
- Tukey evokes values underlying rationale behind use of tests 
  - Did not envy physics, did not want the reductionist "mathematization of nature", did not want extension of Weberian rationality 
  - Wanted judgement, experience and even pluralism
- Tukey advocated for empiricism based in perception and sense
  - Manifesto called Data Analysis and Behavioral Science or
Learning to Bear the Quantitative Man’s Burden by Shunning Badmandments
  - Three criticisms of significance tests: sanctify results, reduce to binary decision (signal vs. noise), crowd out other analytical tools
- "Probabilistic worlds require both techniques for producing
knowledge under conditions of uncertainty and, as Theodore Porter has shown, institutions for producing trust, perhaps even faith, in such knowledge." 
- "...subjective judgement, driven by empirical perceptions, must shepherd quantification across threacherous spans" 
- Tukey was friends with Claude Shannon 
- Tukey gave data an agentive voice 
  -  "After the single-minded pursuit of optimality, “the next fetish to be attacked,” he suggested with some relish, “is
the fetish of objectivity,” understood as “the fallacy that to a single body of data there corresponds a unique appropriate analysis.”
  - Not procedural, mechanical, optimal valuation of objectivity but a communicative raitonality 
    - Orit Halpern vs. Daston, Galison, and Porter 
- Tukey had a historical understanding of science 
  - Urged behavioral sciences to look to early days of elder sciences - Still problems with Tukey: ideas provide little consensus, connected to him, reflect an elite sensibility (mechanical forms of inference do not have this problem)
- Produces a "scientific self" from Gallison and Daston
