# Preface 

This is a place for me to put notes on academic books/papers I read. 

Idea originally from Ayman Nadeem's [project by the same name](https://github.com/aymannadeem/speedyscholar), but implemented using Yuhui Xie's `bookdown` package, and Sean Kross's [boilerplate](http://seankross.com/bookdown-start/).
