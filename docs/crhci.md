# [_Critical Race Theory for HCI_](./assets/crhci.pdf){target="_blank"}, Ihudiya Finda Ogbonnaya-Ogburu, Angela D. R. Smith, Alexandra To, Kentaro Toyama. {-} 

- Critical race theory as a way to advance inclusive research and also reduce HCI community's racial disparities 
  - Theoretical concepts from CRT: 
    - ordinariness of racism, 
    - social construction of race, 
    - interest convergence (i.e. people in power support progressive goals only when it serves their selfish interst), 
    - intersectionality, 
    - critique of liberalism, 
    - uniqueness of voices of color, and 
    - storytelling as a means of exploring oppression 
- Acknowledged limitation: only consider American context of race 
  - Also burden of representation on work concerning marginalized group
- Suggestions: 
  - Work with and about communities of color 
  - Critiquing and exmining racial bias in technology (as a first step -- race should not be an afterthought, strive for reflexsivity and other-concious)
  - HCI is allied research to CRT (HCI aims to design technological artifacts that work for everyone)
