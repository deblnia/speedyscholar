This is a place for me to put notes on academic books/papers I read. 

Idea originally from Ayman Nadeem's [project by the same name](https://github.com/aymannadeem/speedyscholar), and implemented using Yuhui Xie's `bookdown` package, and [Sean Kross's boilerplate](http://seankross.com/bookdown-start/).
