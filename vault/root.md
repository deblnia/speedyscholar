This is a second edition of Speedy Scholar, a project that is a place for me to put notes on academic books/papers I read.

Idea originally from Ayman Nadeem's project by the same name, and currently implemented using Dendron. 

I also collect less annotated content in [are.na](https://www.are.na/deblina-mukherjee), and my opinions on web writing in an [airtable database](https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invxItS97AlKO9uFL&inviteToken=e332cf65331557f709bc2d3d0cdce9d8196bd1f17a17a49de6b87b296e8fa4b1&utm_source=email).
